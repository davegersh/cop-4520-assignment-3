/*
Things the servants do:
1. Take a present from the bag and add it to the chain in 
the correct location by hooking it to the predecessors link (based on tag number)
- insertion (in the correct order based on tag number)!

2. Write a "thank you" card to the guest and remove the present from the chain
Doing this involves the servant unlinking the presnt from the chain and linking it to then next one
- deletion!

3. Minotaur can randomely ask this servant to check whether a gift is present in the chain or not
- search!
